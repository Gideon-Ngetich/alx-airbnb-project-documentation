# Airbnb Clone – User Stories

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this document is to translate system interactions captured in the use case diagram into actionable **user stories**. These user stories provide a user-centric view of the system's core features and functionalities, forming the foundation for backend development and planning.

## 🧑‍💼 What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability—usually a user or administrator of the system.

They help development teams understand **what** users want to do and **why** they want to do it.

## 🧩 Core User Stories

### 1. User Registration

**As a new user**,  
I want to register an account as a guest or host  
so that I can access the platform and use its features.

---

### 2. Property Listing by Host

**As a host**,  
I want to list my property with details like title, price, and location  
so that guests can find and book my property.

---

### 3. Booking a Property

**As a guest**,  
I want to book a property for specific dates  
so that I can reserve a place to stay.

---

### 4. Payment Handling

**As a guest**,  
I want to securely pay for my booking using my preferred payment method  
so that my reservation is confirmed.

---

### 5. Review System

**As a guest**,  
I want to leave a review after my stay  
so that I can share my experience with other users.

## 🚀 Next Steps

These user stories will guide:
- API endpoint planning (routes, methods, and payloads)
- Database schema refinement
- Testing and validation scenarios
- UI/UX expectations for the frontend (when connected)

For full traceability, each user story can be linked to related tasks in your issue tracker or project management tool (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira, Trello).
