# Airbnb Clone â€“ Backend Project Requirements

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to design and implement the backend system for an Airbnb Clone. This includes identifying and documenting all core features, technical specifications, and non-functional expectations required to build a secure, scalable, and efficient system.

---

## Introduction

Backend development is the foundation of any web application. It involves managing server-side logic, database structure, APIs, authentication, and integrations with third-party services. In this project, the focus is to replicate key Airbnb features through a well-structured backend system.

The requirements have been categorized into:

1. Core Functionalities
2. Technical Requirements
3. Non-Functional Requirements

---

## 1. Core Functionalities

The backend must provide support for all the core functions typical of a rental marketplace like Airbnb. These include:

### 1.1 User Management

- **User Registration**
  - Users can sign up as guests or hosts.
  - Secure account creation using JWT-based authentication.
- **User Login & Authentication**
  - Login using email and password.
  - Optional OAuth integration (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Profile Management**
  - Users can update profile information including contact details and profile photos.

### 1.2 Property Listings Management

- **Create Listings**
  - Hosts can list new properties with details like title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings**
  - Hosts can update or remove their listings at any time.

### 1.3 Search and Filtering

- Search functionality should allow filtering by:
  - Location
  - Price range
  - Number of guests
  - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
- Pagination must be implemented for performance with large datasets.

### 1.4 Booking Management

- **Booking Creation**
  - Guests can book properties for selected dates.
  - Double bookings must be prevented using date validation.
- **Booking Cancellation**
  - Guests and hosts can cancel bookings based on defined policies.
- **Booking Status**
  - Bookings must be tracked using statuses: pending, confirmed, canceled, completed.

### 1.5 Payment Integration

- Integrate secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
  - Guest payments.
  - Host payouts after successful bookings.
- Support multiple currencies.

### 1.6 Reviews and Ratings

- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Reviews must be linked to completed bookings.

### 1.7 Notifications System

- Users should receive email and in-app notifications for:
  - Booking confirmations
  - Cancellations
  - Payment updates

### 1.8 Admin Dashboard

- Admins should have access to a dashboard to:
  - Manage users
  - Moderate property listings
  - Oversee bookings and payments

---

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Database Management

- Use a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- Required tables include:
  - Users
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Payments
  - Reviews

### 2.2 API Development

- RESTful APIs should expose all backend functionality.
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes:
  - `GET` for retrieving data
  - `POST` for creating data
  - `PUT`/`PATCH` for updates
  - `DELETE` for deletions
- Optionally implement GraphQL for more complex queries.

### 2.3 Authentication and Authorization

- Use JWT tokens for session management.
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - Guests
  - Hosts
  - Admins

### 2.4 File Storage

- Store profile photos and property images.
- Use a file storage strategy (e.g., local uploads, AWS S3, Cloudinary).

### 2.5 Third-Party Services

- Integrate with services like:
  - SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

### 2.6 Error Handling and Logging

- Implement centralized error handling for all API responses.
- Log all system activities and errors for debugging and monitoring.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Scalability

- Use a modular codebase to support horizontal scaling.
- Integrate load balancing techniques to distribute traffic.

### 3.2 Security

- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info).
- Implement rate limiting and firewall rules to prevent attacks.
- Apply input validation and sanitization.

### 3.3 Performance Optimization

- Use caching tools (e.g., Redis) to speed up frequently requested data.
- Optimize all database queries and API endpoints.

### 3.4 Testing

- Write unit and integration tests (e.g., using Pytest or Jest).
- Implement automated API testing to ensure endpoint stability.

---

## Summary

This backend system aims to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb. The design ensures:

- Secure and role-based access
- Smooth user experience via real-time booking and filtering
- Reliable and scalable performance
- Well-defined API contracts and database structure

The next step is to implement the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and begin building database schemas, followed by routes, controllers, and middleware based on the structure outlined above.
